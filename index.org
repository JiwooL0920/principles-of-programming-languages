- September 23 :: The completed version of notes 2 is now uploaded.

  Also,
  - *I've had to make one more edit to the provided code*
    *for ~isDigitList~; don't include the cut in the first case*. 

- September 23 :: There has been a change to the
  ~isDigitList~ question in homework 2.
  Please review that question.
  (For those who may have already completed it,
  reversing the list should adapt your current solution
  to the new requirements.)

  Also, unit tests for checking your homework 2
  have now been provided in the homework 2 document.

  Important notes regarding this testing:
  1. Unlike homework 1, for homework 2 it is /mandatory/
     that your code pass these tests.
  2. There is no interface file that you need to complete.
     You still only need submit your ~h2.pl~ file.
  3. Passing these tests does not guarantee a particular grade.
     What has been provided is intended to act as a /sanity check/,
     and more thorough tests may be used in the grading process.

  Instructions and files for using Docker to run the tests
  will be provided later today.

- September 22 :: More recording links have been added to the list.
  Also,
  - The homework boilerplate has been updated
    to indicate that use of the standard
    higher-order operators is always allowed.
  - Instructions for testing homework 1 using Docker are now uploaded
    (obviously too late to be useful, but added for completion's sake.)
    Similar setup and instructions will be added for homework 2 shortly.
  - A poor choice of wording regarding ~isDigitList~ has been changed
    in homework 2; “the first digit of ~X~ ⇒ the “ones” digit of ~X~”.

- September 18 :: Homework 2 has been posted.

- September 18 :: The notes from the live coding lecture
  have been properly placed in that section.

  They will be updated ASAP to include relevant code
  for the upcoming homework.

- September 18 :: Testing code has been uploaded for homework 1,
  in the homework file itself.
  *For this homework, it is optional that you complete the*
  *testing interface and submit it with your homework*.
  For future homeworks and assignments, tests will be provided
  in a more timely manner and required.

  Also note, the requirement to name both instances of
  your ~flatten~ and ~orderedElems~ function the same
  has been dropped.

- September 17 :: A note has been added to the course outline
  regarding use of *plaintext* or *code snippet markup*
  when sharing code in discussions with staff and on Teams,
  *instead of screenshots*.
  Also see the post in the general chat on Teams
  regarding how to use the code snippet formatting tool.

  Additionally:
  - A note was added to homework 1
    regarding the marking of the ~orderedElems~ question.
    And a small error regarding usage of two type parameters
    was fixed in the ~StructTree~ problem.

- September 16 :: The typos encountered in today's lecture
  have all been corrected (if I missed any, let me know.)
  - The first parse tree example has been corrected,
    and I've also massaged the definition of parse tree's a bit
    so that we don't need to draw the “pointless nodes”
    I mentioned. The first example shows what we omit.

  Also note, especially for those in the Monday tutorial,
  the live coding notes on Scala have been updated.
  - A motivation section has been added which should better
    describe why we are coding the way we are in Scala.
  - One further update will be coming with some changes
    that came up during today's tutorial.

- September 15 :: Each student of this course should now have a
  (private) GitLab repository, at the address
  https://gitlab.cas.mcmaster.ca/cs3mi3-2020-student-repos/macid
  where ~macid~ is your McMaster ID.
  
  There were some initial issues with the ~master~ branch being protected,
  so you could not ~push~ to it; those should be resolved now.

  Please ~commit~ and ~push~ to your repo ASAP,
  even if it's just some placeholder files,
  to confirm everything is working.

  Please /do/ use the ~master~ branch for submitting homework.
  There is no need to create other branches for this course,
  though you are free to do so if you want to.

  If you seem unable to log in to the CAS GitLab,
  please try to follow the instructions to reset your CAS password
  that are located to the left of the login form.

- September 15 :: A recordings section has been added to this website
  with links to the recordings of lectures and tutorials on Streams
  (which I hope work for everyone, and not just me).

- September 14 :: The (still a bit incomplete) live coding notes
  from lecture and tutorial today have been posted.
  Note the new section along the top for these notes.
  They'll be cleaned up after Wednesday's tutorial.
  
- September 14 :: To address some questions which have come up
  in lectures and tutorials so far:
  - “Are we going to alternate between different programming languages
    or will we stick to Scala for a while?”
    - A good question, and something I meant to discuss
      but never got to.
      
      The rough timeline for introducing languages is intended to be
      - September 14th: introduce Scala (today)
      - September 18th: introduce Prolog (Friday)
      - October 7th: introduce Ruby
      - November 6th: introduce Clojure
      Assignment 1 will use Scala and Prolog,
      assignment 2 will use Scala and Ruby, and
      assignment 3 will use Prolog and Clojure.
      Homeworks may alternate sometimes, but I intend to focus on
      the languages which are being used for the current assignment
      in each homework.

      This is a much faster pace for
      picking up a language than previous courses,
      but we are usually focusing on a relatively small number
      of ideas in each language.

      Leverage what you know from previous courses,
      ask lots of questions (please!),
      and when in doubt, look closely at provided examples.

  - “Can we use IntelliJ for Scala?”, “Do we have to use Ammonite?”, etc.
    - You can use whatever tools you wish to for writing your code
      and interacting with Scala.
      On our end, we will be using Ammonite, but
      there should not be conflicts,
      and I intend to release a Docker image you can use
      to test for conflicts later this week.
  - “Do we have to use Docker?”
    - Not explicitely, though it's /strongly/ encouraged.
      Docker images will be provided so you can ensure
      your code works on the system it will be marked on.
      It is unlikely we will encounter conflicts in any case,
      but it is better to be certain by using the Docker images.
  - “Will live coding lecture and tutorial notes be posted?”
    - Yes, they will be posted, and should be available
      in the usual set of formats.
  Also,
  - Note that homework 1 was updated over the weekend
    with submission guidelines and a homework code of conduct
    related to collaboration. Please review it.

- September 11 :: Homework 1 has been uploaded and can be found
  under the homework section.
  - I am aware of the issues with the images in the PDF version;
    they will be fixed shortly.
  Also of note:
  - The Monday lecture will be a live coding session introducing
    some basic Scala concepts.
  - The tutorials will be running next week, and will be used
    to discuss Scala further.
  
- September 11 :: Reminder that the first lecture is today, at 1:30pm.
  It will be in the lectures and tutorials channel in Microsoft Teams.

- September 11 :: The first section of notes,
  [[1 – Introduction and overview]], is now complete and uploaded.

- September 9 :: The Microsoft Teams team for the course
  has been activated. Please ensure you have access,
  and contact me ASAP if you do not.

- September 7 :: I have decided to cancel
  the Wednesday lecture for this week, in support
  of [[https://scholarstrikecanada.ca/][Scholar Strike Canada]] and their mission
  “to protest anti-Black, racist and colonial police brutality
  in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.”
  I encourage everyone to spend the lecture time
  and any other time you have that day on
  the public digital teach-ins they are offering.

  The scholar strike is planned for September 9^{th} and 10^{th}.
  Note that the Friday lecture on the 11^{th}
  will still take place as scheduled.
  Note also that there are no tutorials scheduled this week.


- September 6 :: As of this point, I am waiting on UTS to allow me
  access to the course Microsoft Teams team.
  If this is not done by Wednesday,
  we will be using Zoom for lectures until I am able
  to activate  the team.


- September 6 :: The course outline is in near complete state;
  I am still waiting for confirmation of the teaching assistants.
  - In particular, please review the information on grading;
    we will not be having midterm or final exams for this course.
