# TODO: Announce tutorials for week starting 

- September 11 :: Homework 1 has been uploaded and can be found
  under the homework section.
  - I am aware of the issues with the images in the PDF version;
    they will be fixed shortly.
  Also of note:
  - The Monday lecture will be a live coding session introducing
    some basic Scala concepts.
  - The tutorials will be running next week, and will be used
    to discuss Scala further.
  
- September 11 :: Reminder that the first lecture is today, at 1:30pm.
  It will be in the lectures and tutorials channel in Microsoft Teams.

- September 11 :: The first section of notes,
  [[1 – Introduction and overview]], is now complete and uploaded.

- September 9 :: The Microsoft Teams team for the course
  has been activated. Please ensure you have access,
  and contact me ASAP if you do not.

- September 7 :: I have decided to cancel
  the Wednesday lecture for this week, in support
  of [[https://scholarstrikecanada.ca/][Scholar Strike Canada]] and their mission
  “to protest anti-Black, racist and colonial police brutality
  in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.”
  I encourage everyone to spend the lecture time
  and any other time you have that day on
  the public digital teach-ins they are offering.

  The scholar strike is planned for September 9^{th} and 10^{th}.
  Note that the Friday lecture on the 11^{th}
  will still take place as scheduled.
  Note also that there are no tutorials scheduled this week.


- September 6 :: As of this point, I am waiting on UTS to allow me
  access to the course Microsoft Teams team.
  If this is not done by Wednesday,
  we will be using Zoom for lectures until I am able
  to activate  the team.


- September 6 :: The course outline is in near complete state;
  I am still waiting for confirmation of the teaching assistants.
  - In particular, please review the information on grading;
    we will not be having midterm or final exams for this course.
