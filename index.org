:TODO: finalise this information

This course is currently planned to have weekly [[Homeworks][homeworks]],
three longer [[Assignments][assignments]],
and either a final project or exam.

All homeworks and assignments are to be submitted via your
Computing and Software GitLab account.

The homeworks are graded for completion,
and the two lowest grades are not used in calculation
â€”this also allows each student to miss two homeworks without penalty.
The assignments are more thoroughly graded.

:TODO: make links
See [[][Grading]] and [[][Missed work]]
in the course outline for details about grade calculations
and procedures for missed work.
