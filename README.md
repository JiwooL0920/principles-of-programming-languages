# Communication

## September

  - September 7  
    I have decided to cancel the Wednesday lecture for this week, in
    support of [Scholar Strike Canada](https://scholarstrikecanada.ca/)
    and their mission “to protest anti-Black, racist and colonial police
    brutality in the U.S., Canada and elsewhere.” I encourage everyone
    to spend the lecture time and any other time you have that day on
    the public digital teach-ins they are offering.
    
    The scholar strike is planned for September 9<sup>th</sup> and
    10<sup>th</sup>. Note that the Friday lecture on the 11<sup>th</sup>
    will still take place as scheduled. Note also that there are no
    tutorials scheduled this week.

  - September 6  
    As of this point, I am waiting on UTS to allow me access to the
    course Microsoft Teams team. If this is not done by Wednesday, we
    will be using Zoom for lectures until I am able to activate the
    team.

  - September 6  
    The course outline is in near complete state; I am still waiting for
    confirmation of the teaching assistants.
    
      - In particular, please review the information on grading; we will
        not be having midterm or final exams for this course.

## August

  - August 3  
    Incomplete course outline added to homepage.

## Lecture literate programs

The last lecture of each week is usually a hands-on live programming
session.

Literate copies of the programs developed in those lectures are
available here.

## Lecture hand-written notes

In some cases, some handwritten notes accompany the slides during
lecture. This term, those notes will be written on paper that can be
seen during the online lecture.

When possible, those notes are scanned and made available here.
