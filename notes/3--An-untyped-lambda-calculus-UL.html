<h2 id="Introduction"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>
In this section we construct our first simple programming language,
an untyped λ-calculus (lambda calculus).
</p>

<p>
More specifically, we construct a λ-calculus
without (static) type checking (enforcement),
but including the natural numbers and booleans.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-What-is-the-λ-calculus?">
<h3 id="What-is-the-λ-calculus?"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> What is the λ-calculus?</h3>
<p>
The λ-calculus is, put simply,
a notation for forming and applying functions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Because the function (procedure, method, subroutine) abstraction
gives us a means of representing control flow,
if we have a means of representing data,
the λ-calculus is a Turing-complete model of computation.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-History">
<h3 id="History"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> History</h3>
<p>
The (basic) λ-calculus as we know it was famously invented
by Alonzo Church in the 1920s.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This was one culmination of a great deal of work by
mathematicians investigating the foundations of mathematics.</li>

</ul>

<p>
As mentioned, the λ-calculus is a Turing-complete model of computation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Other models proposed around the same time include
<ul>
<li>the Turing machine itself (due to Alan Turing), and</li>
<li>the general recursive functions (due to Stephen Cole Kleene.)</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Hence the “Church” in the “Church-Turing thesis”.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The λ-calculus has since seen widespread use in the study and design
of programming languages.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It is useful both as a simple programming language, and</li>
<li>as a mathematical object about which statements can be proved.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-Descendents-of-the-λ-calculus">
<h3 id="Descendents-of-the-λ-calculus"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Descendents of the λ-calculus</h3>
<p>
Pure functional programming languages are clearly descended
from the λ-calculus; the λ-calculus embodies their model of computation.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Additionally, it is common to have a “lambda” operator
which allows definition of anonymous functions.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Imperative languages instead use a model of computation
based on the <i>Von-Neumann</i> architecture,
</p>
<ul>
<li>which matches our real-world computing devices!
<ul>
<li>Hence imperative languages are naturally lower-level;
one level of abstraction closer to the real computer
that functional languages, which must be translated
to imperative code in order to run.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>This model of computation is a natural extension
of the Turing machine, rather than the λ-calculus
or recursive functions.</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-The-basics">
<h2 id="The-basics"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> The basics</h2>
<p>
In our discussion of abstractions, we mentioned
the abstraction of the function/method/procedure/subroutine.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The functional abstraction provides a means
to represent control flow.</li>

</ul>

<p>
In its pure version, every term in the λ-calculus
is a function.
</p>
<ul>
<li>In order for such a system to be at all useful,
it must of course support higher-order functions;
functions may be applied to functions.</li>
<li>Values such as booleans and natural numbers
are <i>encoded</i> (represented) by functions.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-The-terms">
<h3 id="The-terms"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> The terms</h3>
<p>
The pure untyped λ-calculus has just three sort of terms;
</p>
<ul>
<li>variables such as \(x\), \(y\), \(z\),</li>
<li><i>λ-abstractions</i>, of the form \(λ x → t\),
<ul>
<li>(it is also common to use \(․\) in place of \(→\);
we prefer \(→\) as it emphasises that these are functions)</li>
<li>where \(x\) is a variable and \(t\) is a λ-term, and</li>

</ul></li>
<li>applications of the form \(t u\)
<ul>
<li>where \(t\) and \(u\) are λ-terms.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-Informal-meaning-of-terms">
<h3 id="Informal-meaning-of-terms"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Informal meaning of terms</h3>
<p>
The meaning of each term is, informally:
</p>
<ul>
<li>A λ-abstraction \(λ x → t\) represents a function of one argument,
which, when applied to a term \(u\), substitutes
all free occurrences of \(x\) in \(t\) with \(u\).</li>
<li>An application applies the term \(u\) to the function (term) \(t\).</li>
<li>A variable on its own (a free variable) has no further meaning.
<ul>
<li>Variables are intended to be <i>bound</i>.</li>
<li>“Top-level” free variables have no meaning (on their own).
<ul>
<li>Until we construct a new term by λ-abstracting them.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-Variable-binding;-free-and-bound-variables">
<h3 id="Variable-binding;-free-and-bound-variables"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Variable binding; free and bound variables</h3>
<p>
Recall the notion of free and bound variables.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A <i>variable binder</i> is an operator which operates on
some number of <i>variables</i> as well as <i>terms</i>.
<ul>
<li>Examples include quantifiers
such as \(∀\_❙\_•\_\), \(∃\_❙\_•\_\) and \(∑\_❙\_•\_\),
and substitution \(\_[\_→\_]\).</li>

</ul></li>
<li>(For simplicity, let us assume below that variable binders
act on a single variable and a single term.)</li>
<li>Let \(B\_•\_\) range over the set of variable binders in a language.</li>
<li>An occurrence of a variable \(x\) in a term \(t\) that is <i>not</i> in
a subterm of the form \(B x • u\) is called <i>free</i>.</li>
<li>In a term \(t\) with a subterm of the form \(B x • u\),
all free occurrences of the variable \(x\) that occur within \(u\)
are <i>bound</i> by that instance of the binder \(B\).
<ul>
<li>Note: instances of \(x\) which are bound elsewhere are not bound
by that \(B\).</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-Picturing-variable-bindings">
<h3 id="Picturing-variable-bindings"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Picturing variable bindings</h3>
<p>
For instance, in the language of predicate logic,
we can view the variables bound like so.

<section id="slide-Representing-functions-with-multiple-arguments">
<h3 id="Representing-functions-with-multiple-arguments"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Representing functions with multiple arguments</h3>
<p>
You may have noticed that our method for constructing function
in the λ-calculus (the λ-abstraction)
only allows us to construct single-argument functions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, we do not have terms such as \(λ(x,y) → t\).</li>
<li>This may seem restrictive,</li>
<li>but it turns out to be sufficient.
And it keeps the language simpler theoretically.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-Currying">
<h3 id="Currying"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> Currying</h3>
<p>
Rather than complicating our set of terms by admitting
functions of multiple arguments, we use the technique
of <i>currying</i> functions.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider a function \(f : A × B → C\).</li>
<li>We can substitute a new function \(f′ : A → (B → C)\)
for \(f\).
<ul>
<li>(By convention, function arrows associate to the right,
so this is equivalent to \(f : A → B → C\).)</li>
<li>So \(f′\) is a function which takes an \(A\) and
<i>produces a function</i> of type \(B → C\).
<ul>
<li>We usually don't give this new function a name.</li>
<li>We can consider this new function as having a <i>fixed</i> value
for the \(A\) argument that was provided.</li>
<li>(So we must be able to represent higher-order functions
to use Currying.)</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<h3 id="The-operational-semantics-of-/UL/"><span class="section-number-3">4.2</span> The operational semantics of <i>UL</i></h3>
<p>
The semantics of the λ-calculus is given by a <i>reduction strategy</i>;
</p>
<ul>
<li>A reduction is a transformation from a term of the form
<ul>
<li>\((λ x → t₁) t₂\) to</li>
<li>\(t₁[x ≔ t₂]\)
<ul>
<li>(There are various syntactic representations of substitutions;
we prefer to the substitution operation to come after the term
where the substitution is carried out (\(t₁\)), and to use
the “becomes” operator to imply free instance of \(x\) become \(t₂\).</li>
<li>Pierce instead uses the form \([x ↦ t₂]t₁\), with the
substitution operation coming before the term,
and using the “maps to” operator instead of “becomes”.</li>
<li>You may also see forms such as \([x\backslash t₁]\) or \([t₁/x]\).)</li>
