<h2 id="org34dbc98"><span class="section-number-2">2</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>
This section introduces several concepts
relating to names and bindings of those names.
</p>

<p>
Of particular note is <i>scope</i>, the “visibility” of names
throughout a program.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-org9c9203c">
<h3 id="org9c9203c"><span class="section-number-3">2.1</span> What's a binding?</h3>
<p>
A <i>binding</i> is a general term that refers
to any association between an entity and an attribute.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a very vague definition, which allows us to apply it
to a great many instances.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The <i>entities</i> are “syntactic units” of the language.
</p>
<ul>
<li>That is, some piece of the language syntax.</li>

</ul>

<p>
The <i>attributes</i> may happen to also an entity of the language,
or may be a more “external” concept.
</p>

<p>
For instance,
</p>
<ul>
<li>a variable (entity) will usually have a name (attribute)
<ul>
<li>and often a type (attribute),</li>

</ul></li>
<li>a type (entity) should have also have a name (attribute).</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgf31f261">
<h3 id="orgf31f261"><span class="section-number-3">2.2</span> Uses of names</h3>
<p>
Many entities may be have names bound to them;
</p>
<ul>
<li>variables, constants, parameters/arguments,</li>
<li>functions, methods, procedures, subroutines,</li>
<li>modules, packages, contexts, typeclasses, records, and</li>
<li>types,</li>

</ul>
<p>
to name a few.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgaca7f70">
<h3 id="orgaca7f70"><span class="section-number-3">2.3</span> Persistance of names</h3>
<p>
Take note!
</p>
<ul>
<li>Some namings are “global”; they persist for “all time and space”.
<ul>
<li>Such as the namings of builtin language methods,
<ul>
<li>(assuming the language does not allow their names to be reused
or shadowed.)</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>But many namings are temporary!
<ul>
<li>And one instance of a name may shadow another.
<ul>
<li>(Such as when you declare a local variable/argument
with the same name as one already in scope.)</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgf76c0e7">
<h3 id="orgf76c0e7"><span class="section-number-3">2.4</span> A note about time and space</h3>
<p>
Throughout these notes, we will discuss <i>when</i> and <i>where</i> bindings
are in effect.
</p>

<p>
These discussions of “time” and “space” are relative to the program.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Our notion of “<i>time</i>” is in terms of the program's runtime.
<ul>
<li>Or occasionally, its design time.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Our notion of “<i>space</i>” is in terms of the program's <i>text</i>.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org0cb82c5">
<h3 id="org0cb82c5"><span class="section-number-3">2.5</span> Static and dynamic bindings (or “checking of bindings”)</h3>
<p>
Bindings which are decided (or known) <i>before</i> runtime
are called <i>static</i>.
</p>

<p>
Conversely, bindings which are not decided (or known) until <i>during</i> runtime
are called <i>dynamic</i>.
</p>

<p>
We say “or known” because some bindings, such as the types of values,
are not so much “decided” as “discovered”.
</p>
<ul>
<li>All values have a type, whether or not that type is checked
statically or dynamically.</li>

</ul>

</section>
</section>
<section>
<section id="slide-org0129acc">
<h2 id="org0129acc"><span class="section-number-2">3</span> Type checking and polymorphism</h2>
<p>
Type checking is the process of determining
the binding between a name of an entity and a type.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually, only variables, arguments, functions and similar entities
have types.
<ul>
<li>There is at least one exception to this;
sometimes, types may have a type!</li>

</ul></li>
<li>We will discuss types in more detail in the next section.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org17c9ff5">
<h3 id="org17c9ff5"><span class="section-number-3">3.1</span> “Dynamically checked” instead of “dynamically typed”</h3>
<p>
As with many bindings, languages can be categorised as
being either <i>statically</i> or <i>dynamically</i> typed.
</p>

<p>
In “Types and Programming Languages”, though, Pierce argues
that the term “dynamically typed language” is a misnomer.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It would be better to say “dynamically (type) checked”.</li>
<li>All values have a type, even before type checking.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgdcec85f">
<h3 id="orgdcec85f"><span class="section-number-3">3.2</span> Static and dynamic type checking</h3>
<p>
It's somewhat natural for interpreted languages to be dynamically typed,
and compiled languages to be statically typed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>The process of type checking is an upfront cost.
<ul>
<li>Compilation is a natural time to carry out that costly process.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Consider the (primarily) interpreted “scripting” languages;
Python, Ruby, Javascript, Lua, Perl, PHP, etc.</li>
<li>But it's far from universally true that interpreters use
dynamic typing!
<ul>
<li>Haskell has an interpreter, and is definitely
statically typed.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orga3aaa4e">
<h3 id="orga3aaa4e"><span class="section-number-3">3.3</span> Polymorphism</h3>
<p>
Assigning each value in a program a single type, and then
enforcing type correctness (preventint type clashes)
introduces a (solveable) problem; it prohibits code reuse!
</p>
<ul>
<li>Subroutines can only be used on a particular type of arguments.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Subtyping and polymorphism provide solutions to this.
</p>
<ul>
<li>With <i>subtyping</i>, there is a sub/super relation between types.
<ul>
<li>One classic examples involves a type of “shapes”, which has
a subtype “polygon”, which in turn has subtypes “triangle”
and “rectangle”, etc.</li>
<li>Subtypes closely resemble the notion of <i>subsets</i>.</li>
<li>Values of a subtype can be used anywhere
a value of their supertype is expected.</li>
<li>Sub-<i>classing</i> is one instance of subtyping.
<ul>
<li>And is usually just called subtyping.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Subranges and, sometimes, enumeration types are other examples.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>With <i>polymorphism</i>, a subroutine can have several types.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgf75b7df">
<h3 id="orgf75b7df"><span class="section-number-3">3.4</span> Ad hoc polymorphism (overloading)</h3>
<p>
One notion of polymorphism is <i>ad hoc</i> polymorphism,
also called <i>overloading</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>With overloading, subroutine names
can be reused as long as the types of arguments
differ (in some specified way).</li>
<li>The downside is the programmer must define
the “same” subroutine many times; once for each type.</li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org623ab72">
<h3 id="org623ab72"><span class="section-number-3">3.5</span> Parametric polymorphism</h3>
<p>
With parametric polymorphism, subroutines have a
<i>most general</i> type, based on the <i>shape</i> or <i>form</i> of their arguments.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This involves the use of <i>type variables</i>.</li>
<li>The subroutines behaviour can only be based on the form,
not the specific types.</li>
<li>This is commonly used in functional languages.
<ul>
<li>Several object-oriented languages have <i>generics</i>, which are
essentially the same concept.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

</section>
<section id="slide-org5e65701">
<h3 id="org5e65701"><span class="section-number-3">3.6</span> Duck typing</h3>
<p>
More formally called <i>row polymorphism</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Types are not actually checked.</li>
<li>We only check that an entity has the correct method defined for it.</li>
<li>“If it walks like a duck, and quacks like a duck, it's a duck!”</li>

<h2 id="org0e57a1d"><span class="section-number-2">4</span> Lifetime</h2>
<p>
The <i>lifetime</i> of an entity is the portion of the runtime
(not the code) during which that entity has allocated memory.
</p>

<p>
To discuss lifetimes, we first need to discuss
the layout of memory and the process of memory allocation.
</p>

</section>
<section id="slide-orgb76c1ef">
<h3 id="orgb76c1ef"><span class="section-number-3">4.1</span> The data segment, stack, and heap</h3>
<p>
In the context of running a program (or a thread of a program):
</p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>data segment</i> is a portion of memory used to store the
program itself and static/global variables.</li>
<li>The <i>stack</i> is an organised portion of memory allocated for the program.
<ul>
<li>Blocks at the “top” of the stack are reserved when entering
a scope.
<ul>
<li>These blocks are called <i>stack frames</i>.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Stack frames are <i>popped off</i> the stack when leaving the unit of code.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>The <i>heap</i> is an unorganised portion of memory allocated for the program.
<ul>
<li>Allocation/deallocation may be independent of units of code.</li>
<li>Disorganisation can lead to inefficiency and other problems.
<ul>
<li>Cache misses, page faults, etc.</li>
<li>Running out of memory or appropriately sized continguous blocks.</li>
<li>Garbage, dangling references, etc.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>

<li>Implicit heap dynamic
<ul>
<li>Allocation is dynamic, automatic, and on the heap.</li>
<li>Memory is simply allocated when the variable is assigned;
the programmer does not need to “do anything”.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Explicit heap dynamic
<ul>
<li>Allocation is dynamic, <i>manual</i>, and on the heap.</li>
<li>The programmer must use a command to allocate memory
<i>before</i> assignments can be made.
<ul>
<li>E.g., <code>malloc</code> or <code>new</code>.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>In fact these blocks of memory can be considered

<section id="slide-org8037614">
<h3 id="org8037614"><span class="section-number-3">4.7</span> The lifetime</h3>
<p>
To repeat,
the <i>lifetime</i> of an entity is the portion of the runtime
(not the code) during which that entity has allocated memory.
</p>
<ul>
<li>There may be several <i>instances</i> of a single variable in the code,
each with its own lifetime.</li>
<li>The lifetime of a variable depends upon the memory allocation
strategy used for it.
<ul>
<li><b>Static</b>: lifetime is the whole of runtime.</li>
<li><b>Stack dynamic</b>: lifetime is the portion of runtime between
when the scope containing the variable is entered
and when control returns to the invoker of that scope.
<ul>
<li>In the case of functions/procedures, local variables
end their lifetime when the function/procedure returns.</li>
<li>Note that a variable may go out of scope, but still be alive.</li>

</ul></li>
<li><b>Implicit heap-dynamic</b>: lifetime begins when assigned.
The end of lifetime depends upon garbage collection.</li>
<li><b>Explicit heap-dynamic</b>: lifetime begins when the allocation
command is used. The end of lifetime may be
<ul>
<li>when the programmer issues a deallocation command, or</li>
<li>depend upon garbage collection.</li>

</ul></li>

<h3 id="org7b3ad26"><span class="section-number-3">4.8</span> Garbage collection</h3>
<p>
<i>Garbage</i> is allocated memory which is no longer accessible.
</p>

<p>
<i>Garbage collection</i> is the process of deallocating garbage.
</p>
<ul>
<li>A complex activity.
<ul>
<li>We will discuss the basics here, and then likely not
touch on it again.</li>
<li>Has a large influence on the efficiency of
compiled/interpreted code.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>There are two main categories of garbage collection algorithms;
<ul>
<li>tracing,
<ul>
<li>which includes the “mark &amp; sweep” algorithm, and</li>

</ul></li>
<li>reference counting.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Additionally, language implementations may include compile time
“escape analysis”.
<ul>
<li>Memory may be allocated off the stack instead of the heap
<i>if</i> no references to the variable are available outside its scope
(if it doesn't “escape”).</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

<section id="slide-org1032e7a">
<h4 id="org1032e7a"><span class="section-number-4">4.8.1</span> Tracing garbage collection (mark &amp; sweep)</h4>
<ul>
<li>Usually triggered when a certain memory threshold is reached.</li>
<li>Starting from some set of base references
(usually those in the stack and data segment),
“trace” references, somehow marking those that are reachable.
<ul>
<li>Starting from the set of base references,
“determine the transitive closure of reachability”.</li>

</ul></li>
<li>Once done, free any memory that is not marked.</li>
<li>“Naive” mark &amp; sweep:
<ul>
<li>Each object in memory has a bitflag for this “marking”,
kept clear except during garbage collection.</li>
<li>When activated, traverse all reachable memory,
“marking” what's reached, then “sweep” away all unmarked memory
(and reset the flags of marked memory).
<ul>
<li>With this naive approach, we have to pause the program to do this;</li>
<li>better methods do not require pausing.</li>

<h4 id="org217e075"><span class="section-number-4">4.8.2</span> Reference counting garbage collection</h4>
<ul>
<li>An “eager” approach.</li>
<li>As the program runs, keep a count of the number of references
to every object in memory.
<ul>
<li>So we must perform some tallying on every assignment!</li>

</ul></li>
<li>When the number of references reaches zero, we can free the memory
for that object.</li>
<li>This approach needs to account for cycles, though!
<ul>
<li>Every object in a cyclic (portion of a) data structure
will always have at least one pointer to it,
even if the structure as a whole is unreachable.</li>

<p>
Garbage is not the only problem that can occur with
references to memory.
</p>

<p>
A <i>dangling</i> or <i>wild</i> reference is a reference to memory
which has already been freed.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Presumably, by a programmer's action.</li>
<li>After being freed, memory may be left as is until it
is allocated again, or may be wiped in some way.
<ul>
<li>Accessing memory that is no longer reserved
usually leads to undefined behaviour.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul>

We will discuss methods of preventing use of wild/dangling references
when we discuss reference types later in the course.

<h2 id="orgac787c8"><span class="section-number-2">5</span> Scope</h2>
<p>
A <i>scope</i> (singular) is a portion of the program to which the visibility
of entities may be limited.
</p>
<ul>
<li>This is a design decision: what constructs introduce scopes?
<ul>
<li>Almost certainly subroutines do.</li>
<li>Do conditional branches? Loop bodies?</li>

</ul></li>
<li>As a general term, within this section we say <i>block</i> for a construct which
introduces a scope.

singular <i>scope</i> for this, but here that will conflict with
the adjective scope we are about to define.</li>

The <i>scope</i> (adjective) of an entity is the portion of the program
in which it is “visible”.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Usually scope is statically determined.
<ul>
<li>It is usually the block in which it is defined,
and all subblocks of that block,
<ul>
<li>unless it is shadowed by another entity of the same name.</li>

</ul></li>

</ul></li>
<li>Static scoping is so pervasive, you have likely
never come across a language where scope works differently,

<h3 id="org5f487d9"><span class="section-number-3">5.2</span> Dynamic scoping</h3>

With dynamic scoping, the scope of entities depends upon the

<h3 id="org82a8379"><span class="section-number-3">5.4</span> Exercise: Entities which introduce scope</h3>
<p>
In a few different programming languages, investigate whether
condition branches and loop bodies introduce scopes.
</p>

<p>
I.e., test out code such as
</p>
<div class="org-src-container">

<pre  class="src src-text"><code trim>if B then
  int x = 0
endif

y = x   % Is x still in scope?
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
Specifically, investigate languages which have <i>iterating loops</i>,
(usually called <code>for</code> loops). What is the scope of an iterator
for such loops?
